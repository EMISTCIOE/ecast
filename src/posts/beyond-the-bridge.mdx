```
I write everything  
as though you're reading it, but I'll write this  
as though you're not-  
I'm not sure I ever loved you, but I'm just as unsure  
if I'll ever  
stop.  

I write everything so that you hate me  
I write to make you angry   
I write to make you hate me   
I write so that you can hate me   
and  
I would still be happy   
If you hated me   
if you were mad but   
the destiny of world   
where you don't even have a speck of feelings  
and I have nothing but feelings   

I thought  
what's the worst that could happen, and I thought heartbreak   
but I didn't think this.  
I didn't think the absence of answers could hurt more than one I didn't want to hear.  
I want to hear one, just one.  
I want you to believe  
I deserve one.  

I knew some of the hardest truths are that  
what you prioritize  
will not always prioritize you  
and  
what you want  
will not always want you  
and  
what you love  
will not always love you  
and  
I always choose you   
I always loved you   
I always wanted you   

I understand that you   
needed to burn the bridge, you but did you need  
to burn it  
with me  
Still on it?  

I pretend to be alive, 
I pretend that I am fine,  
I pretend that my heartbeats don't thud  
I pretend that I don't feel them,  
that it's business as usual  
inside of my chest.  
I pretend that my smiles are more   
than just gritted teeth.  
I pretend I am with you   
I pretend that I mean them,  
I pretend to be alive ,  
I pretend that I am fine.  

we know I'm not for you.  
But you are still the silence between each wild heartbeat,  
the tangled and warm peace  
I can't find on my own.  
You cannot be  
but were, but are  
the only quiet place I know.  
And so you are,  
though you should not be,  
still the quiet place I go.  

I joke that my I hit myself every time I say your name.   
I keep a tally of how many times I say it.   
It might be in the hundreds, is probably in the thousands.  
I am not tired of it, I don't let on, can't let on, which is why that's the only place I still say it  
Nobody else wants to hear it.  
Can I blame them?   
I probably can't blame them.  
I can't blame them   
I can't stay like this   

I try to hold onto the small things—  
where you are drifting more and far away from my reach   
where I couldn't feel you   
where I can't see you  
where I can't hear you   
and   
I try to hold onto the small things—  
the way you laughed at the most ordinary moments,  
the pauses in your words when you were thinking,  
the warmth that always seemed to reach me even when you were silent  
It’s like this emptiness inside me is growing,    
and all I want is you to fill it,    
just for a moment,    
just so it hurts a little less.  
It feels like the world is moving without me,  
but I’m stuck,  
wanting to freeze everything, just so I can see you,  
so I can listen to your voice,  
because maybe, if I hear you,  
the pain will stop for a moment,  
and I can breathe again.  

And I want to breathe again   
I want to feel again
